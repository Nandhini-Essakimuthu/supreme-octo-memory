The Mumbai Property Analysis and Prediction project is designed to analyze and predict property prices in Mumbai while assessing associated risks. The project utilizes a dataset, 'Mumbai1_with_risk.csv,' containing information about various property features, prices, and risk levels.

The initial steps involve preprocessing the data, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and creating new features. Specifically, a logistic regression model is implemented to predict the risk level of properties as either 'Low' or 'High.' The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and a classification report.

In parallel, a linear regression model is developed to predict property prices. The evaluation metrics for this model include mean squared error and R-squared. Additionally, K-Means clustering is applied to segment customers based on property features, providing insights into customer segmentation.

The project also includes a section that identifies and displays the top 10 highest-risk entries. Visualizations, such as scatter plots, line plots, and 3D scatter plots, are created to provide a comprehensive view of the data and model predictions.
